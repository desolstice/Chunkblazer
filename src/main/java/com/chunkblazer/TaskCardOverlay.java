/**
 * The task-roll reveal: freshly rolled tasks arrive as face-down cards in the middle of
 * the viewport and stay there until the player flips them.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists as a gate, not just decoration.</b> A rolled task is not added to
 * the active list — and is not registered with any tracking module — until its card is
 * turned over. That is the whole point of the feature: the roll should feel like opening
 * a pack rather than silently gaining five list entries. The pending set lives in config
 * ({@code unrevealedTasks}), so cards left unflipped are still waiting after a relog.
 *
 * <p><b>What flipping does NOT do.</b> It does not decide the task. The roll itself is
 * already committed to {@code regionRolledTasks} the moment it happens, so refusing to
 * flip a card you don't like cannot reroll it — the card is a reveal, never a gamble.
 *
 * <p>Art lives in {@code Task_Cards/} ({@code front_<tier>.png} / {@code back_<tier>.png},
 * see {@link TaskCardTier}). Missing art is drawn as a flat tier-coloured card rather
 * than skipped, so the flow is testable before the assets land.
