	// XP gain in the same tick window as a kill means the dead NPC was the player's
	// ASSIGNED monster — a name-agnostic "on the right task" signal.
	//
	// TIMING (Mike's goblin, session_2026-07-16 14:57:04): the XP arrives AFTER the
	// death, not during its tick. The log is unambiguous — the kill is confirmed and
	// the verdict sent at 14:57:04, and the Slayer XP / SLAYER_COUNT decrement land at
	// 14:57:05. An earlier version of this comment claimed the gain was "already
	// recorded" by end-of-tick and the gate only looked BACKWARDS, so a genuinely
	// on-task kill was refused every time. No backwards window can fix that — widening
	// it only reaches further into the past, where the evidence still isn't. So
	// on-task-gated deaths are HELD (see heldDeaths) until the XP arrives or the wait
	// expires. The window then covers skew in either direction.
	//
	// HOW LATE (Cruk's goblin task, session_2026-07-30 16:17–16:20): the delay is not
	// a fixed one tick — it VARIES kill to kill, and a 2-tick wait loses the race
	// roughly a third of the time. Of 17 verifiably on-task goblin kills (the in-game
	// counter ran 17 → 0), only 11 were credited; 6 were refused with "Not on a slayer
	// task for this monster" and the SLAYER_COUNT decrement is right there in the log
	// AFTER the verdict, one to two ticks too late. The wait is now generous, which
	// costs nothing when the evidence is prompt: the hold resolves the moment it
	// arrives, so only genuinely off-task kills ever wait the full duration.

	// evidence of the two — and the two do not always land on the same tick, so
	// accepting EITHER wins races that either alone would lose.
	//

	// fast kills once the window is six ticks wide: killing rats or cows in quick

	// them would read that single signal as its own evidence. Two ways that pays
	// out credit nobody earned — kills landing in the 3.6s after a slayer task
	// FINISHES (the last on-task signal is still in range), and a gated task for
	// monster X being credited by the evidence from your actual assignment to Y
	// when both die close together. Claiming makes evidence one-kill-one-credit.
	//
	// Pairing: the counter decrement and the Slayer XP for the SAME kill land on
	// the same tick, so whichever arrives first creates the entry and the other
	// tops up rather than duplicating. Multi-kills are handled honestly because
	// the counter drops by the number killed, not by one.

	// DECREASE means our cannon just fired. That is the only clean, first-party
	// signal available: a cannonball's hitsplat is an ordinary DAMAGE_ME splat with
	// nothing to distinguish it from a whip hit.
	//
	// Why a rule is needed at all, when the fight timer now starts at the cannon's
	// first hit: a cannon fires up to 4 balls in ONE tick, so it genuinely one-shots
	// small NPCs. Cruk's scorpion (session_2026-07-16_20-00-46) took 17 damage and
	// died in the same tick it was first hit — a real 0-tick kill that satisfied
	// "Defeat a Scorpion in the First Hit" honestly. No timing logic can refuse that;
	// only an explicit "no cannon" rule can.
	//
	// NOTE: this REPLACES the `varbit_id: 57` constraint that 35 tasks carried with
	// the message "Cannon use is prohibited for timed combat tasks". Varbit 57 is
	// BOARDGAMES_DRAUGHTS_MUSTTAKE — a draughts board game — so it read 0 forever and

	// ── Fights we have a stake in, keyed by NPC index ────────────────────
	// One record per NPC we have personally damaged. This REPLACED a single
	// currentTarget/damageDealtToTarget/combatStartTick triple that was only ever
	// populated from onInteractingChanged — i.e. it required the player to have
	// manually clicked the NPC. Two consequences, both reported by testers on
	// 2026-07-16 and both visible in session_2026-07-16_14-49-35:
	//
	//   1. A CANNON kill involves no interaction, so no target was ever set, every
	//      hitsplat was dropped, and the death was rejected for having 0 damage.
	//      Cannon kills produced no [NPCKILL-DEBUG] line at all — the plugin never
	//      saw them (Mike: "killed some goblins with a cannon — did not get [any]
	//      message from these"). Cannon-only kills credited nothing.
	//   2. Worse, cannon damage did not start the clock. Cruk chunked a scorpion to
	//      10% with a cannon and finished it with a whip: combat "started" at the
	//      whip hit, so a 1-tick "in the First Hit" task (that is how those are
	//      authored — see defeat_scorpion_first_hit, max allowed 1 tick) passed.
	//      Cannon-softening laundered every timed task.
	//
	// Keying by index rather than holding one target is what makes cannon safe: a
	// cannon hits several NPCs per tick, and a single slot would thrash between them
	// and mis-attribute damage. A record is created by the FIRST hitsplat WE land,
	// whatever the source (melee, cannon, thrall, poison), so the fight timer starts
