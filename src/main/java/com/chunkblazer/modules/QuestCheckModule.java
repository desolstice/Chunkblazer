/**
 * Module for handling QUEST_CHECK completion type tasks — the "Global Tasks"
 * pool, which is region-independent and active for every account from load.
 *
 * constraints.quest holds the net.runelite.api.Quest enum constant name (e.g.
 * "DRAGON_SLAYER_II"). Quest.getState() runs the QUEST_STATUS_GET script, which
 * resolves that quest's varp/varbit AND its per-quest "finished" threshold
 * internally and normalises the answer (2 == FINISHED for every quest). So
 * unlike VarbitCheckModule this module keeps no per-task varp id or expected
 * value — the enum name is the entire configuration.
 *
 * SWEEP COST: getState() is a client script invocation, and the Global Tasks
 * pool is ~200 tasks. Checking every task on every VarbitChanged (which fires
 * many times per tick, especially on login and region change) would mean
 * thousands of runScript calls in a burst. Instead a VarbitChanged only marks
 * the pool dirty; the actual sweep happens on GameTick, at most once every
 * SWEEP_INTERVAL_TICKS. Quest completion is not latency-critical — a couple of
 * seconds between finishing a quest and the task ticking off is fine.
